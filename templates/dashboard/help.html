  <h3>What is BomRadar?</h3>
  <p>
    BomRadar is an AI-powered fraud detection system designed to monitor
    financial transactions and flag suspicious activity in real time.
  </p>

  <h3>How does fraud detection work?</h3>
  <p>
    Transactions are analyzed using a machine learning model trained on
    historical credit card data. If a transaction appears risky, it is flagged
    for review.
  </p>

  <h3>What happens if my transaction is flagged?</h3>
  <p>
    The transaction will be temporarily blocked and you will receive a
    notification explaining the reason.
  </p>
